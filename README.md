# Support Vector Machines for Survival Analysis

# Overview

This repository contains the code and final report for my analysis and recreation of the methods from the paper “Support Vector Machines for Survival Analysis with R”. The project focuses on implementing and evaluating regression, ranking, and hybrid approaches using the Veterans’ Administration Lung Cancer dataset.

# Contents
	•	STOR390 Final.RMD: Scripts for recreating survival SVM methods (regression, ranking, and hybrid) and evaluating them across linear, additive, and RBF kernels.
	•	Evaluating Statistical and Ethical Implementations of Support Vector Machines for Survival Analysis with R.pdf: A comprehensive document detailing results, analysis, and ethical considerations.

# Highlights
	•	Recreated and extended the analysis presented in the paper.
	•	Explored kernel-specific performance and hyperparameter tuning.
	•	Provided ethical discussions on fairness, bias, and patient privacy in predictive models.
